    "## Description: Systematic roll up of annotation terms from a broad set of sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The planned outcome is a method to classify/aggregate terms for end-users in a systematic, explainable, and defensible way. The intention is to help end-users when they are ask, “what does your platform cover?”. That is a complex question that depends on what is of interest to the users and the context of the question but providing a list of 7000 features with some annotation or links is not a satisfying answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outcome\n",
    "The ideal outcome is to be able to respond to a user: ‘What is your primary area of interest?’ then go to a high-level classification of terms related to the user’s interest and approach to proteomics (and be able to drill down from that high level)."
